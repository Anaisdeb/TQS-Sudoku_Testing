# TQS-Sudoku
Create a Sudoku generator and solver for Java, then test it with JUnit Testing in Eclipse

This library for Java and Android provides the basis for the project : [Sudoku](https://github.com/a11n/sudoku).

## MVC software architectural pattern : 
  * *Model* (Data)
    * Ranking with time and name of the player
    * Saving of the Sudoku board if the user closes the game in progress
    * TXT file or MongoDB
  * *Controller* (Logic)
    * Generate the sudoku and check the player's inputs
  * *View* (Display) 
    * TXT file

## Homework for the 18th of October: 
  * Study this [git repository](https://github.com/a11n/sudoku)
  * List the items to be modified from this library
  * Think about the graphical interface: txt or other?
